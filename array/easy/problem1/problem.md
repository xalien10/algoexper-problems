 **Two Numbers Sum**
 
Given an array of distinct numbers and a target sum. You need to find a 
two elements whose sum will be equal to the target sum.
Then return those two numbers in an array. You don't need to
consider order of the array elements. If you can not find
the pair then return an empty array.

example: 

1. array = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6]
targetSum = 10

result = [11, -1]

2. array = [14]
targetSum = 15

result = []
